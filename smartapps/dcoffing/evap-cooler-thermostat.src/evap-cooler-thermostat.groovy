   Virtual Thermostat for Evaporative Coolers 
   Copyright 2016 Dale Coffing
   
   This smartapp provides automatic control for Evaporative Coolers (single or two-speed) using 
   any temperature sensor. On a call for cooling the water pump is turned on and given two minutes
   to wet pads before fan low speed is enabled. The fan high speed is turned on if the temperature 
   continues to rise above the adjustable differential. There is an optional motion override.
   
   It requires these hardware devices; any temperature sensor, a switch for Fan On-Off, a switch
   for pump. For two speed control is desired another switch will be necessary.
   I suggest a Remotec ZFM-80 15amp relay for fan motor on-off, if you desired both pump and fan speed
   then Enerwave ZWN-RSM2 dual 10amp relays to control pump and the second relay to control hi-lo speed
   via Omoron LY1F SPDT 15amp relay. For only pump control any switch could work like the Enerwave ZWN-RSM1S
   or Monoprice #11989 Z-Wave In-Wall On/Off module
    
  Change Log
  2016-06-28 added submitOnChange for motion so to skip minutes input next if no motion selected
 			changed order of inputs for better logic flow
            added separate input page for Configuring Settings to reduce clutter on required inputs
            change to other mode techinque to see if it will force a reevaluate of methods
            renamed fanHiSpeed to fanSpeed for more generic use, added 0.0 on timer selection
            changed motion detector minutes input only if motion selected submitOnChange
  2016-06-22e added single speed default
  2016-06-22d change user guide content
  2016-06-22c modified icon to fan style, breeze style for comparison
  2016-06-22b moved pump input to first position (required), made other selections not required	for those with single speed motor
  2016-06-22 added icons
  2016-06-21 modify 3-speed-ceiling-fan-thermostat code for outlets

  
  Known Behavior from original Virtual Thermostat code
  -(fixed) when SP is updated, temp control isn't evaluated immediately, an event must trigger like change in temp, motion
  - if load is previously running when smartapp is loaded, it isn't evaluated immediately to turn off when SP>CT
